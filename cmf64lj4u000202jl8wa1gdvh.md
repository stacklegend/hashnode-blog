The development of information technology in the 1990s was a dynamic period that fundamentally transformed our world. This decade saw the birth of innovations and technologies that laid the foundation for the digital age, opening up new dimensions in everyday life, the world of work, and entertainment alike.

## **The Golden Age of Computing – The 1990s as a Watershed**

In the 1990s, the possibilities offered by computing suddenly expanded explosively as technological progress reshaped everyday life. This decade witnessed not only the rapid development of hardware and software but also the spectacular emergence of the information society, when computers were no longer just the privilege of experts but increasingly became an integral part of homes. The digital revolution rewrote business models, communication habits, and even infused our culture with the novel energy of IT.

Innovations emerged that have become part of our lives, while certain elements of the old world faded into oblivion. The pre-millennium years of IT innovation were marked by a pioneering spirit and naivety, as businesses and developers often experimented "blindly" with digital solutions to everyday problems. This era laid the foundations for digital self-expression, information freedom, and a globally connected society.

## **Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, and the Rivalry of Tech Titans**

On the IT battlefields of the 1990s, two names emerged as a kind of pop culture duel: Bill Gates and Steve Jobs. They were not just businessmen but modern myth-makers who shaped the market with radically different styles and visions. Gates believed in the universality of software, while Jobs passionately emphasized the importance of design and user experience. Their rivalry not only steered their companies but also entire industries onto new paths.

This struggle sparked intense innovation: Windows and Macintosh operating systems constantly competed for market favor, building cult followings along the way. All this left its mark on software development, marketing, and user expectations alike. The "Microsoft vs. Apple" duel remains an iconic example of how leaders can become true sources of inspiration for global generations.

## **From Windows 3.1 to Windows 98 – The Evolution of Operating Systems**

The Windows generations of the 1990s were indispensable links in the evolutionary chain of computing. The release of Windows 3.1 was a breakthrough: its graphical interface, stability, and ease of use brought unprecedented popularity. This was a time when the concept of the "Start" button did not yet exist, but the software already enabled multitasking and even began to introduce network functionality into workplaces.

However, Windows 95 changed everything: the introduction of the operating system combined the legacy of the past with a modern, icon-based, Start menu-equipped user environment. Windows 98 then confidently rode the wave of the Internet revolution, supporting USB and significantly improving the plug-and-play experience. These innovations collectively launched the mass adoption of desktop computing.

## **The Launch of Windows 95 – When the Start Menu Made History**

On August 24, 1995, Microsoft launched Windows 95 with a global campaign, marking a turning point in the history of IT. The Start menu, taskbar, and mouse-centric navigation redefined the computer user experience. The use of computers as mass communication tools no longer required special technical expertise – it was enough to "start" something, and the interface adapted to the user.

The idea of the Start menu proved so timeless that Microsoft operating systems have retained this paradigm to this day. The now-nostalgic sounds, icons, and styles still evoke the novelty and innocent experimental spirit of those decades. Windows 95 broke down the wall between ordinary people and computer technology, paving the way for the Internet boom.
