The creation of the Altair 8800 coincided with the microprocessor revolution, which radically reduced the size and cost of computers. The use of the Intel 8080 processor made it possible for a previously unimaginably large computer to fit in the home and be affordable.

This revolution was not just about hardware; it brought a new paradigm in programming and data processing. Microprocessor technology paved the way for the rapid development of personal computers, which were no longer limited to research institutes or large corporations.

## **MITS and Ed Roberts' Role in Creating the Altair**

The Altair 8800 was developed by Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems (MITS), led by Ed Roberts. Roberts' engineering genius and entrepreneurial spirit were key to the project's success. Although the company previously focused on microelectronic devices, the creation of the Altair set a new direction for the business.

Roberts' vision was to create a fully home-assembled, easy-to-build computer. This idea sparked a wave in both the community and industry, which later led to the global spread of personal computers.

## **Initial Design and Technical Specifications**

The design of the Altair focused on simplicity and functionality. The machine was based on the Intel 8080 processor, one of the most advanced microprocessors of its time. Users received a modular, expandable system that allowed for custom hardware and software upgrades.

Specifications included an initial 256 bytes of memory, which could be expanded later, as well as LED-based displays and mechanical switches. This combination made the machine educational, interactive, and innovative.

## **Altair 8800 Hardware Structure and Main Components**

The Altair 8800 featured a modular bus system, giving users flexibility to add new cards and peripherals. In addition to the motherboard, the machine included the processor, memory, and control units, which communicated directly with the LED displays and switches.

This architecture allowed users to create their own expansions, such as memory or I/O cards. The thoughtful design made the Altair an icon of the hobby computer movement, making computing experimentation accessible to everyone.

## **The Computer Case, LED Display, and Switches**

The Altair 8800 was visually distinctive: housed in a metal case, with LED lights indicating memory and processor status. The front panel featured rows of mechanical switches for direct data input, memory address selection, and program execution.

This interactive interface was not only visually engaging but also educational. Users could directly interact with the computer's operation, which was unusual at the time but laid the foundation for the future of personal computing.
