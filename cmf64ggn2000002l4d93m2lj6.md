The 1980s were the golden age of the IT industry, when personal computers revolutionized everyday life and laid the groundwork for the modern digital world. This decade brought legendary companies and innovations that still define the technological landscape today, from Apple founded in a garage, to the Microsoft DOS operating system, to the first game consoles.

## **The Global Boom of Personal Computers**

At the start of the decade, personal computers available for just a few thousand dollars soon reached millions worldwide, transforming homes, offices, and schools. The IBM PC, debuting in 1981, set a standard, while the Apple II family remained a favorite among creative users with its easy-to-use graphical interface and color display.

The global spread was fueled by the emergence of compatible clones, which significantly reduced prices and made technology more accessible. Japan took a leading role in hardware manufacturing, especially in semiconductors and memory chips, while Europe developed its own computer culture with the popularity of the Commodore 64 and Amstrad CPC. By the end of the decade, personal computers were no longer a luxury but essential work tools, paving the way for the internet revolution of the next decade.

## **The IBM PC and Its Impact on the Corporate World**

The launch of the IBM PC in 1981 radically transformed the corporate world, legitimizing the use of personal computers in serious business environments. The authority and reliability of "Big Blue" convinced executives that personal computers were not just toys but valuable business tools. Companies bought IBM PCs en masse, revolutionizing office work and introducing the Microsoft DOS operating system to a wide user base.

IBM's open system approach had unexpected consequences – within a year, more than 750 software packages became available for the platform, while hardware manufacturers began selling memory expansion cards. Over the decade, the performance of IBM personal computers increased tenfold compared to the original PC, system memory grew from 16 kilobytes to 16 megabytes, and storage capacity increased 10,000-fold. This explosive growth and the appearance of compatible clones paradoxically led to a decline in IBM's market share: from an initial 80% dominance to just 20% by the 1990s.

## **The Macintosh and the Revolution of the Graphical User Interface**

On January 24, 1984, Apple introduced the Macintosh, forever changing the nature of computer use by popularizing the graphical user interface (GUI) and the mouse. Priced at $2,495, the Macintosh was the first computer for home users to fully utilize a graphical interface, abandoning the command line and introducing icons and a cursor. Steve Jobs and his team, inspired by Jef Raskin's idea and a visit to Xerox PARC, developed the machine after seeing the potential of the graphical interface.

The Macintosh became a cultural icon, helped by Ridley Scott's epic TV commercial aired during the 1984 Super Bowl. Jobs believed so strongly in the mouse that the Macintosh keyboard had no arrow keys, forcing users to adopt the new navigation method. The development focused on synergy between software and hardware, and Jobs, leveraging his knowledge of typography, had Susan Kare design several elegant fonts named after world cities.

## **The Global Rise of the Commodore 64**

After its January 1982 launch, the Commodore 64 became an unprecedented success, earning the Guinness World Record for best-selling desktop computer with 12.5–17 million units sold. With an initial price of $595, the C64 soon dominated the low-end computer market, especially in the US, where it achieved a 30–40% market share between 1983 and 1986, selling two million units annually. Its success was driven by aggressive pricing – President Jack Tramiel made it a personal mission to undercut Texas Instruments, dropping the price by $200 within two months, then to $300 in June 1983, and as low as $199 in some stores.

Globally, the C64's expansion was mixed: in the US, Commodore sold as many C64s as all other competitors combined, but in Europe, it faced tough competition. In the UK, the ZX Spectrum, BBC Micro, and Amstrad CPC 464 dominated, with the C64 only second to the Spectrum. In France, the ZX Spectrum, Thomson computers, and Amstrad prevailed, while in Japan, the NEC PC-8801, Sharp X1, and Fujitsu FM-7 limited its presence to about six months. In Finland, however, it achieved extraordinary popularity, with about three units per 100 residents, earning the nickname "The Republic's Computer."
