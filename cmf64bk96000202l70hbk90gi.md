The 1970s was a decade of revolutionary transformation in the IT industry, when the earliest forms of personal computers and the first software appeared, laying the foundation for today's digital world. This period brought technological breakthroughs such as the development of microprocessors and the spread of the first commercial computer systems, which forever changed the direction of humanity's technological progress.

## **The Dawn of the IT Industry – Why Look Back at the 1970s?**

The 1970s was not just another decade in the history of the IT industry—it was a revolutionary era that forever changed the future of humanity by laying the foundations of the digital world as we know it. Like the Renaissance or the Industrial Revolution, this era brought about technological and social transformations whose impact is still felt in every smartphone, laptop, and online interaction. The uniqueness of the decade lies in the simultaneous birth of microprocessor technology, the modern foundations of operating systems, the concept of the personal computer, and the network communication that would evolve into the Internet—four pillars that support the entire infrastructure of today's information society.

Looking back at the 1970s is especially instructive because it was the last period when a single person could still grasp the entire field of computing, and when today's tech giants were still operating as garage startups. This era proves that the greatest revolutionary changes often arise during the toughest economic times—the innovations that today create trillions in economic value emerged amid oil crises and social tensions. The story of the seventies also shows how a narrow technological field can become a global phenomenon, permeating every industry and area of life, and becoming the driving force behind the next fifty years of economic and social development.

## **The Social and Economic Environment of the 1970s That Shaped the IT Industry**

The economic crises and social changes of the 1970s paradoxically provided fertile ground for the IT revolution. Amid the economic difficulties triggered by oil crises, companies were forced to seek new ways to cut costs and increase efficiency. During this period, business leaders realized that data was not just an administrative tool but a resource of real business value—a mindset that directly foreshadowed today's big data era.

During the decade, a fundamental change occurred in the corporate perception of data: while previously it served only to automate routine tasks, by the 1970s it began to be treated as "raw material" from which valuable information could be extracted for management decision-making. The emergence of database management systems (DBMS), such as IBM IMS (1971) and Cullinane IDMS (1971), provided the technological foundation for this new approach, while professional journals like Datamation enthusiastically promoted the "database-based approach" among management. This cultural and technological transformation had such a profound impact that it fundamentally shaped the information technology development of the following decades and the modern understanding of the strategic value of data.

## **Early Developments in Computing: Laying the Foundations**

The IT revolution of the 1970s had deeper roots than the breakthroughs of the era might suggest—it was actually built on computing foundations shaped over millennia. The first mechanical calculator, the abacus, appeared about 5,000 years ago, when humanity realized that increasing social complexity and trade required counting larger sets of items. With the emergence of specialization and division of labor, more efficient counting methods became necessary, leading to the development of number systems—most commonly the decimal system.

In the 19th century, Charles Babbage (1792-1871) formulated fundamental principles for programmable calculators that directly anticipated the architecture of the microcomputers of the 1970s. Babbage's requirements—punched card program control, separate input and output units, memory, and arithmetic unit—were almost perfectly realized in the Intel 8080-based systems of the 1970s. George Boole's logical algebra (1847-54) laid the groundwork for digital circuit design, while Konrad Zuse's Z3 machine (1938-1941) already included a processor, control unit, memory, and input/output units—practically all the essential components of modern computers. This historical continuity explains why the innovations of the 1970s were so quickly and widely adopted.

## **The Invention of the Microprocessor – The First Step Toward Personal Computers**

The birth of the microprocessor took place between 1969 and 1971, when several companies worked in parallel to integrate the central processing unit of a computer into a single chip. Garrett AiResearch began developing the Central Air Data Computer (CADC) for fighter jet systems as early as 1968, resulting in the MP944 chipset in June 1970—a 20-bit, 28-chip system that technically preceded the later famous commercial microprocessors.

The real breakthrough, however, came with the Intel 4004, developed under the leadership of Federico Faggin for the Japanese Busicom calculator company. From the project's original seven-chip concept, Faggin and his team created a four-chip solution, including the 4-bit 4004 microprocessor, which contained 2,300 transistors and supported 46 instructions. The first shipments began in March 1971, but the first publication about the processor appeared only on November 15, 1971, in Electronic News. At the same time, Texas Instruments introduced its own TMS 1000 series on September 17, 1971—the first single-chip, commercially available microcontroller. This technological race and the subsequent microprocessor developments enabled the creation of fourth-generation personal computers from the mid-1970s, which became accessible to almost anyone due to their low price.
