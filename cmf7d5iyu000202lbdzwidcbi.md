IBM's roots go back to the late 19th century, when the industrial revolution demanded new tools and business solutions. From timekeeping devices to payroll machines, numerous innovations paved the way for a global technology giant. In a rapidly industrializing world, the need for data management and mechanization of processes grew steadily.

The company's predecessors were born from the merger of several smaller firms, all sharing the goal of automated data processing. These companies recognized that the future lay in fast and accurate information management. From this realization grew the organization that would later become a defining force in the history of computing.

## **Founding Circumstances and Background**

In 1911, the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company (CTR) was established, considered the predecessor of modern IBM. CTR was formed by merging several companies specializing in data processing and measuring devices. This merger enabled the company to offer a broad product portfolio on the market.

The founding circumstances reflected the dynamism of American industry, where the demand for mechanization and efficiency grew daily. CTR initially lacked global influence but already showed the organizational and technological traits that would later become world-famous under the IBM name.

## **The Company's Development in the First Half of the 20th Century**

In 1924, CTR adopted the name International Business Machines (IBM), signaling global ambitions. In the 1930s, the company strengthened its position in punch card data processing, while other industries increasingly demanded automated systems. IBM's products made business operations more efficient.

During World War II, IBM played a crucial role in supporting military and logistics systems. This period reinforced the company's technological and strategic significance. After the war, IBM operated as a company that defined the directions of modern data processing.

## **Pioneer of Computing**

IBM played a pioneering role in the history of computing. Even in the early decades, it created systems that set new standards in the industry. The combination of computing power and reliability was the hallmark of IBM's products.

IBM opened a new era in data processing when its machines could process vast amounts of information quickly. This transformation affected not only the business world but also advanced scientific research and government projects.

## **Punch Card Systems and Their Significance**

Punch card systems were among IBM's first major successes. These devices could handle, store, and process structured data, revolutionizing administrative work. Banks, insurers, and government agencies quickly adopted these technologies.

The simplicity and reliability of punch cards enabled widespread use. This system first proved that automated data processing was not a luxury but an essential tool in the modern economy. IBM built its reputation in this field, securing long-term market dominance.

## **IBM's Role in the Emergence of Mainframe Computers**

In the 1950s, IBM led the development of mainframe computers. These massive, central computers could serve the IT needs of entire companies. The IBM System/360 series was a milestone in computing history.

Mainframes impressed the world not only with their size but also with their reliability and processing capacity. These systems ensured IBM's leading role in enterprise IT infrastructure for decades. The mainframe legacy is still present in the business world today.
