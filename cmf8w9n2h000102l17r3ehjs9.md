Microsoft is one of the world's most influential technology companies, shaping the IT industry for decades. Its activities range from software development to cloud services and artificial intelligence, with a global impact felt in every segment of digital culture. The company's history is a series of innovations and strategic decisions that have defined the evolution of modern computers and enterprise infrastructures.

The company's dynamic growth, from its beginnings to entering the global market and shaping technological trends, has been driven by more than just product qualityâ€”it is also rooted in corporate culture and leadership philosophy.

## The Beginnings: Bill Gates and Paul Allen Meet

Bill Gates and Paul Allen discovered their shared passion for programming during their high school years. Both possessed extraordinary talent in computing and, even at a young age, were able to solve complex problems and develop software. This close intellectual bond laid the foundation for their later business collaboration.

Their meeting was not just a personal connection but a pivotal event in the history of IT. Their shared interests and willingness to take risks quickly led them toward the business world, enabling the birth of one of the largest software companies of the future.

## First Steps in the Software Industry

The Gates-Allen duo's first projects were simple software solutions for local businesses. These early developments gave them practical experience in how the industry worked and helped them understand market needs. Their strategic thinking was evident even then.

The young entrepreneurs quickly realized that the value of software lay not only in technology but also in market applicability. This insight later defined Microsoft's business model, which combined innovation with commercial success.

## Founding Microsoft and the First Offices

In 1975, Gates and Allen officially founded Microsoft, initially working out of a small office developing custom software. In its early years, the company operated in a flexible, project-based structure, quickly adapting to industry changes.

The founding enabled the building of strategic partnerships, especially with microprocessor manufacturers. This period was crucial, as it set the company's future focus: developing operating systems and applications for personal computers.

## Early Products: Altair BASIC and Other Developments

Altair BASIC was their first major software project, running on the Altair 8800 computer. This development was significant not only technologically but also because it showed that Microsoft could bring software to market and generate revenue.

Alongside BASIC, early developments included applications that simplified computer use. These products established Microsoft's reputation as an innovative and reliable software producer and demonstrated the company's flexibility in adapting to technological changes.

## The Birth of the DOS Operating System

The DOS operating system, officially known as PC-DOS, was a milestone for Microsoft. The system quickly became popular in the personal computer market due to its simplicity, stability, and ease of installation. The introduction of DOS clearly marked the beginning of Microsoft's dominance in operating systems.

DOS's success was based not only on technological advantages but also on strategic licensing policies. Microsoft allowed other manufacturers to use the system, leading to widespread adoption and securing a long-term market position for the company.
